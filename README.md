TechRoots – Student Curriculum Hub
Welcome to TechRoots!
TechRoots is a student-led STEM program where you learn engineering and electronics by building hands-on projects.

In TechRoots, you’ll work in small groups, experiment with components, and learn how engineers think by designing, testing, and improving simple systems.

You do not need prior experience — curiosity and willingness to try are enough.

What You’ll Find Here
This repository is where TechRoots lessons and resources are shared. It includes:

Step-by-step lesson guides
Project instructions
Materials lists
Each folder represents a session or activity.

How Sessions Work
Students usually work in pairs (2 students per kit)
Each session introduces a new concept
You’ll build something during every session
There is always time to experiment and ask questions
Materials & Kits
Arduino-based starter kits
LEDs, resistors, buttons, and sensors
Printed or digital worksheets
All materials are safe and designed for classroom use.

Safety First
Follow all instructions given during sessions
Ask an adult or instructor if you’re unsure about anything
No high-voltage or dangerous components are used
Notes
This space will continue to grow as new lessons are added.
Feel free to explore the materials and come ready to build and learn.

If you have questions, ask during the session — we’re here to help!
