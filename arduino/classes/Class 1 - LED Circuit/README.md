# Simple LED Circuit (Battery Powered)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic electrical circuit using a **battery, resistor, and LED** on a breadboard.  
It teaches how electricity flows in a closed loop and why polarity and resistors matter.

This is a **no-code** beginner project.

## Materials
- LED  
- Resistor (330Ω–1kΩ)
- 9V battery  
- 9V battery snap  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  


## Wiring Steps
1. Connect the **red battery wire** to the breadboard.
2. Connect the **blue/black battery wire** to the breadboard.
3. Place the resistor from the positive side to a row on the board.
4. Connect the **long leg of the LED** to the resistor.
5. Connect the **short leg of the LED** back to the negative side.

## Expected Result
- LED turns **on** when wired correctly
- LED stays **off** if reversed or disconnected

---

## Notes
- LEDs only work in one direction
- A resistor is required to protect the LED
- Disconnect the battery when finished
