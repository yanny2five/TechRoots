# Servo Motor Basics – TechRoots

## Project Overview
This project introduces students to **servo motors** using an Arduino.  
The servo moves to different angles (0°, 90°, and 180°), showing how **code can control physical movement**.  
It is designed as a beginner-friendly TechRoots lesson and often serves as a student’s **first motor-based project**.

##  Learning Objectives
By completing this project, students will:
- Understand what a **servo motor** is
- Learn how **angle-based control** works
- See how software directly controls hardware
- Gain confidence wiring and programming simple circuits

---

## Materials Required
- Arduino Uno  
- Servo motor (SG90 or equivalent)  
- Jumper wires  
- Breadboard (optional)  
- USB cable  

---

##  Wiring Instructions
Servo motors have **three wires**:

| Servo Wire Color | Connect To |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Red | 5V |
| Brown / Black | GND |
| Yellow / Orange | Digital Pin 9 |

Make sure all connections are secure before uploading the code.
